# 🌙 Chronosleep

**Chronosleep** is a smart sleep and night-routine management project designed to help you sleep better, wake up calmer, and understand how your body interacts with time — not just another alarm app.

The core idea is simple but deep:
**optimize your Circadian Rhythm using data, adaptive logic, and a calm user experience.**

## 🧠 Concept

Not everyone thrives on the same sleep schedule.
Chronosleep aims to:

* Understand your *real* sleep pattern
* Suggest realistic sleep & wake times
* Reduce fatigue, insomnia, and late-night overthinking

This is **not a medical product**, but a **self-awareness and organization tool**.
